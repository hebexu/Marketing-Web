About the project
This project is helping to improve the web accessibility and help people to access the website legally.
When I review the source code, then I find semantic HTML elements is good.
When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find there are some improvements for following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, so I modified some of them and made some comments in style.css file.
When I view the image elements, I find they are good.
TBD
